	<h1>Archer Malmo</h1>
	<p>Archer Malmo was a very fun place to go and learn about what things web developers do. They took the time out of their day to go and tell us what they do at work. They were all super friendly people who were very warm and welcoming. We had 4 speakers in total talking to us about their typical day and sharing information on web designing. They shared information with us about what their job is (in depth) and what they were currently working on. 
	<p> Out of our 4 speakers nobody said they disliked their job, in fact they all loved their job a lot. One of the main speakers shared with us that he didn't get to where he was today by taking the traditional route. The others, however, did end up where they are by geither going to college or being self-taught.e

		The work environment was probably my favorite thing overall. It kind of reminded me of a different version of a google office. They had so many quirky things such as a christmas tree in the office that was a ladder with christmas lights wrapped around it. They also had my favorite thing in the world - PUPPIES!!! I thought it was so cool that they just let the puppies just run around, granted they were well-behaved. </p>
	<p> When they took us on a tour of their office we got to see everything from a few people's offices to the basement where they will record advertisements for customers. I found it really interesting that it is a very open place and that some people come and go whenever as long as their stuff is complete. I was at first a bit skeptical because I didn't see many female workers and I didn't want to seem like one of the only females interested in web technology, but as we progressed in the tour I was surprised they have a nice mix of men and women both at the office. Overall, my experience at Archer Malmo was an amazing experience that I'm grateful for. It was truly a great time. </p>
